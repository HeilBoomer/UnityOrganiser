  |Masters(Grouping Tools)|
  
      *Masters are grouping tools with different types of filtering options.
      
      While using masters you can -> 
      
        - Filter Objects with layers, tags or with the recorder.
        - Draw bezier curves to these filtered objects.
        - Carry all of these filtered objects in the Editor.
        - Draw Gizmos on these filtered objects.
        - Auto select all of the filtered objects.
        - Visualize these filtered objects.
      
      Tag Master: 
      
      -> Tag Master allows you to group (filter) objects with a specific tag.
      
      Layer Master:
      
      -> Layer Master allows you to group (filter) objects with a specific layer.
      
      Group Master:
      
      -> Group Master works a little bit different than the other masters, you should select the objects with your bare hands.
      - If you don't want any of the filtering options above, with Group Master you can simply record(select) the objects you want.
